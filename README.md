# **JHTracker**
A simple Job Hunter Tracking programming. It is focused on implementing CRUD methods and RESTful architecture principles. 

This repository showcases my front-end and back-end capabilities. It is meant to show a more in-depth look into my back-end development knowledge and skills.

# **Features**
* **Front-end development**: The main page has a simple and minimal UI. The technologies used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All requests are used with JSON. 
* **Back-end development**: The core of the back-end is built on Java and the Spring Framework, specifically Spring Boot. Structured to display my understanding of microservices. Uses a MySQL database connection but can easily switch to other common databases.
* **Manage Your Applications**: Keeps track of your job applications while keeping important notes about it. 

# **Future Developments**
* Add a tech tracker to keep track of the most used and requested technologies in the list.
* Automatically update the display of applications based on date, time, and other factors.
* Add sorting functionality in the display of applications.
* Add animations for a more clean look.
